(a) Develop a Tic-Tac-Toe agent using the MCTS algorithm. The number of Monte Carlo simulations
allowed for each board configuration must be configurable (12 Points)
(b) Test the efficacy of the MCTS agent by soliciting move recommendations for the following
board configurations (3 Points)
• A suitable board configuration in which the MCTS agent is one move away from win
• A suitable board configuration in which the MCTS agent is one move away from loss
• The board configuration where the opponent has made the first move and has occupied
the centre square
(c) Record the number of wins, loss and draws by letting the MCTS agent play 1000 games
against random and safe agents of Assignment 2 (3 Points)
(d) Record of the number of wins, loss and draws by letting the MCTS agent play 1000 games
against itself
